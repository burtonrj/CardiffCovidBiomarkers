==================================================================================================

This is the accompanying source code for our manuscript on the contribution of an extended testing panel at Cardiff and the Vale Health Board during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic (link pending). The research question and cost analysis was led by [Dr Mark Ponsford](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/people/view/1245689-Ponsford-Mark) whilst statistical analysis and modeling was performed by [Ross Burton](https://www.linkedin.com/in/burtonbiomedical/?originalSubdomain=uk). All the source code shown here was authored by Ross Burton, a member of the [Eberl Lab](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/people/view/78691-eberl-matthias) at [Cardiff University Infection and Immunity Research Institute](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/medicine/research/divisions/infection-and-immunity)

This project leveraged the newly created clinical registry created by Ross Burton, Leitchan Smith, and Dr Robert Andreas: the [Cardiff Hospital Admissions Database (CHAD)](https://github.com/burtonrj/CHAD).

All code is written Python >=3.7. See `conda_env.yml` for requirements and packages used.
